# AlgorithmPractice
Contains practice algos from various websites including my solution, and the best solution I found.

AlgorithmPracticeSheet.py contains pythonic solutions, fully commented. 
algos.js contains JS algos, fully commented.

After I learn more about Unit Testing in Python and JavaScript, I'm going to use these sheets to both practice writing Algorithms and 
to practice writing Unit Tests. 

I will use this same repository to practice algorithms when I move on to learning TypeScript and C#. I may or may not rewrite unit tests for the new languages. To be determined depending on how much free-time I have while practicing.
