# AlgorithmPractice
Contains practice algos from various websites including my solution, and the best/most clever solution I found.

algos.py contains pythonic solutions, fully commented. 
algos.js contains JS algos, fully commented.

After I learn more about Unit Testing in Python and JavaScript, I'm going to use these sheets to both practice writing Algorithms and 
to practice writing Unit Tests.
